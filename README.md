# Building-Logisctic-Regression-from-scratch
Creating binary image classifier of 'cat' or 'no cat' with logistic regression from scratch, without using any inbuilt ML library.
We will treat logistic regression as basic neural network with on ehidden layer and one neuron in it.
Output layer has one neuron with sigmoid activation.
We will define subroutines of each task and finally combine all.
